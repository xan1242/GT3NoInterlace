# Gran Turismo 3 - No Interlace patches

These are pnach files you may use in your emulator to disable interlaced rendering in Gran Turismo 3.

All known retail versions of Gran Turismo 3 are supported.

## Known Issues (PAL)

- PAL version has blue screens during fades (between countdowns)

- Certain replay fade effects are also broken

- Trophy rendering has disabled multi-pass rendering - this causes the tropy to be zoomed in the entire screen for a split second

## Why not contribute to the emulator project?

[I've tried.](http://web.archive.org/web/20231012205722/https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2_patches/pull/212) I truly have.

And I've quickly lost the motivation to do so after one of its team members and maintainers (refractionpcsx2 specifically) patronized me, twisted my words and treated me poorly.

Instead of pointing me in the right direction, I was met with an attack and pure disrespect of my patches (which was clearly stated to be a WIP for PAL at the time), which took a week of hard work to create them (still more to go for the PAL version).

This is the result of their actions. Instead of having these patches shipped with the emulator, now it has to be separate.

On top of that, I was blocked by that person from the entire organization over this.

I have nothing against (and have all the respect for) the rest of the team working on the project. I'm open to communication in resolving this matter.
